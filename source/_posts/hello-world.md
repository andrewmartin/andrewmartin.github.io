After a long search, and coincidentally due to patience and timing, I'm finally making an effort to work on my blog. I've chosen a static site generator for the [many other reasons](http://blog.guestlistapp.com/post/2304152860/five-reasons-to-use-a-static-site-generator-instead-of) out there, and so far, I have no regrets.

I chose [Hexo](http://zespia.tw/hexo) for one thing: speed. There are a ton of options out there, no doubt, and I started working in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which I may be regretting down the road, but I must say that the millisecond generation process and overall ease of templating using EJS tags is definitely in my arena.
